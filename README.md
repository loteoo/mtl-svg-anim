```




## Code generators
Generate new Hyperapp components like this:
```
.\node_modules\.bin\hygen component new --name 'my component'
.\node_modules\.bin\hygen complex-component new --name 'advanced component'
```
Available generators are located in the _templates folder  
If you have hygen installed globally, which I recommend, you can do this instead: 
```
hygen component new --name 'my component'
```

## CSS 
PostCSS is ready to go, with nested syntax & rucksack css enhancements.  
https://www.rucksackcss.org/

An opinionated, 'best practices' css reset is loaded in the starterkit as well  
https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css

A starter "theme" is also pre-written for you to edit in /src/app/style.css





### Hyperapp 2.0 TLDR:

State => Data of your app, usually a javascript object  
View => Pure function that maps the State to a DOM representation (called virtual DOM)  
Actions => Pure functions that take in a State, some params, and returns a new State  
Subscribtions => Fancy event listeners that are aware of the State and can dispatch Actions  
Effects => Functions in which you encapsulate side effects to interact with the outside world.  

Use functional programming to describe an application  
Let Hyperapp bring it to life

### Disclaimer:
This is an opinionated setup fine-tuned to how 
I personally build webapps with hyperapp.  
If you're getting started with Hyperapp or with 
JS in general, you can progressively use it's features 
as you learn and stick with what you know. Feel free 
fork and adapt to your needs!
